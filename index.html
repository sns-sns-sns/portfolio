        LLC (Emiddio Vasquez & Peter Eramian) invite you to Asomatos, Limassol, to encounter a concrete sculptural environment cast in-ground and extracted on site, amongst the orange grove trees of Morir Soñando. Following multiple collaborations since 2016, this is their first land work together as LLC, introducing a new framework for their joint research and practice endeavors. <br><br>

      ‘When the ear tells the eye where to look’ interweaves histories of the land, heritage and colonialism to resuscitate alternative modes of listening. LLC presents an environment of ritual, tributing the ear and grounding the act of listening as more than just passive auditory perception, towards deep listening as a social practice that mirrors what Ivan Illich calls “tools for conviviality”. With fragments of broken Cypriot ceramic money-banks – a saving habit of older generations – used to suspend the rebar and then congealed into the concrete sculptures, further suspending the current logics of value production, exchange and extraction.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-1">222555 is a synthesis of an antipode. It's an album of noise and peace, harmony and dissonance, love and anguish, connection and dismantling, cold technology and warm nature. It is a reflection of a common dream we both (Ichomagnetic thoughts) had when we were children and we found out about it randomly (?). In the dream we were both in the same forest, but on opposite sides with contrasting environments experiencing two different micro-worlds. <br><br>

Throughout the album, there are opposing sound materials existing simultaneously. They give meaning to one another, providing direction and sustenance. The space that emerges between these oppositions provides a much needed solace. In the wake of substantial change and dismantling, comes a requiem.<br><br>

      <p class="paragraph-1">Amanda is an artist book by Olga Micińska made in the framework of The Building Institute, an experimental platform aiming to strengthen the position of femmes builders in the domain of technical construction work. Amanda brings together literary texts by Maria Toumazou, Samantha McCulloch, Sepideh Karami and Madeleine Morley, combining fiction stories with visual artwork.<br><br>

Inspired by the "Tradeswomen: magazine for women in blue-collar work" published in the 80's and 90's in the United States, Amanda is a periodical discussing matters of technology and industry from a feminist (not only female) perspective. The first issue contains fiction stories of an emancipatory character, citing trade associations, oil industry in Iran and ghosts of the printer feeders.<br><br>

Publication of the first issue of Amanda is kindly supported by Mondriaan Fonds and Amsterdams Fonds voor de Kunst.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-1">Auf Etwas is a Berlin-based creative studio focusing on digital art and culture, where we push the boundaries of sonic conventions, foster inclusivity, drive social impact and provide a platform for diverse voices.<br><br>

Established in 2011 in Athens, our journey began in the music industry, evolving into artist management, artist liaison, and stage management for high-end artists and venues. Over time, our expertise grew, leading us to venture into full-length films, film festivals, and fashion productions while collaborating with Berlinale, Cannes Film Festival, and Berlin Fashion Week.<br><br>

Driven by a vision to revolutionize the creative industry, we aim to bridge diverse disciplines and create a platform for untold stories while ensuring the appropriate representation in front and behind the camera. Through launching our documentary-style video campaigns for MTV, we have started capturing authentic narratives that address current social taboos and forge profound connections with communities.

      <p class="paragraph-1">Auf Etwas is a Berlin-based creative studio focusing on digital art and culture, where we push the boundaries of sonic conventions, foster inclusivity, drive social impact and provide a platform for diverse voices.<br><br>

Established in 2011 in Athens, our journey began in the music industry, evolving into artist management, artist liaison, and stage management for high-end artists and venues. Over time, our expertise grew, leading us to venture into full-length films, film festivals, and fashion productions while collaborating with Berlinale, Cannes Film Festival, and Berlin Fashion Week.<br><br>

Driven by a vision to revolutionize the creative industry, we aim to bridge diverse disciplines and create a platform for untold stories while ensuring the appropriate representation in front and behind the camera. Through launching our documentary-style video campaigns for MTV, we have started capturing authentic narratives that address current social taboos and forge profound connections with communities.
<br><br>
Led by Eva Mikelatou, an Athens-born, Berlin-based creative producer with a background in music, film, and psychology. Whether it's through sound, film, or other multimedia, Auf Etwas is dedicated to empowering underrepresented communities and redefining the way people experience culture by combining innovative and experimental approaches.</p>
